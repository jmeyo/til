# Relative Line Numbering

Normally Vim uses absolute line numbering where every line is the exact line in a file. To unset this you can run `set nonumber` in your configuration. Using `set relativenumber` your lines will become relative, making it easier to navigate around a file. Turning both relative numbering and absolute numbering on at the same time, the current line's absolute line number will be displayed.

See `:h nonumber` for the section on numbering, both relative and absolute.
